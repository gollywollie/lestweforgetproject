===================
The Lest We Forget Project of Cache Valley is a non-profit business, with the two-fold purpose of connecting the younger generations to older generations, and preserving history of our families that would often otherwise be lost once they pass away.

We do this by creating a scholarship fund, in which high school seniors compete in creating a project based on a life event/experience of an older living relative, especially military veterans. The projects are reviewed and qualified on several different criteria. The students that are selected as having the best projects are awarded the specified scholarship amount.
